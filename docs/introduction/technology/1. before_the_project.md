# 1. Dependencies management.
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is a tool for dependency management 
    and packaging in Python .
1. Install `python 3.7+ 3.11-` which is required for `PySide6` and `Poetry` and create
    virtual env for this project.
2. Install `Poetry` according to the [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
3. After installing `Poetry` successfully, then install the dependencies we need
    with command line `poetry self update && poetry install` in `src folder`.

# 2. Style formatter.


# 1. Document generation tool.
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
Sphinx is a good tool to generate different format of document. In our project, 
    I use html generator to parse google style document string.
First, type `sphinx-quickstart` command in `src/docs` which is used to generate 
    document and the configuration of document will show.
Second, add `autoapi.extension` extension into `conf.py/extensions`. This 
    extension will parse document string into different format.
Third, I change the `BUILDDIR` of `make.bat/Makefile` into `docs/api`. Then We 
    can use `make html` to generator html pages of api.

# Spell check tool.

I use `Code Spell Checker` extension to check the spell of words. The settings is in .vscode/settings which excludes some specific words.
